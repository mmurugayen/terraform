# terraform: deployment and operations backlog

Requested: 2026-09-17. Source reviewed: main at 864e0fc8d9aef550cec231149c8e9f8b0131e349.

Status: **Planned**. Acceptance: **Not run**. Assignees: **Unassigned**. Proposed owner roles require assignment.

Nine shared requirements projected by product. Product projections are not additive top-level features. Preserve all existing feature counts, IDs, states and evidence.

This repository implements diagnostic utilities and a scaffold for future infrastructure contracts. No Terraform resources, Ansible deployment or product runtime exists here. Package/module ownership and consumer qualification are documentation responsibilities, not additive product feature counts.

Diagnostic package/interface only. Assign consuming Terraform/OpenTofu module and Ansible/configuration owners before execution; no such deployment runtime exists here.

[Machine-readable backlog](deployment-operations-2026-09-17.json) · [Blank worksheets](DEPLOYMENT_WORKSHEETS_2026-09-17.md)

This documentation does not authorize deployment, privileged installation, disk erasure or automated remediation. Existing acceptance, IDs, counts and historical evidence remain unchanged.
